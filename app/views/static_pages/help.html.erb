              <p>Everything is done from the List view (<b>Home</b>) or the Tree view (<b>Trees</b>). The basic workflow is to create a list of scientific names (species or higher taxa), click on <b>Get tree</b>, then view the tree.

            <p>In the future, we will provide some support for common names like "raven" (<i>Corvus corax</i>) or "Minke whale" (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>).  At present, you need to supply scientific names.  They are not hard to find-- you can search Wikipedia or NCBI taxonomy, or just use Google (for best results, combine the name with "species" or "taxonomy"), e.g.,
              <ul>
              <li>search "minke whale" at NCBI: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/?term=minke+whale">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/?term=minke+whale</a>
              <li>search "raven species" at Google: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=raven+species">https://www.google.com/search?q=raven+species</a>
              <li>search "goose" at Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=goose">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=goose</a>

            <p>Our ability to deliver trees instantly depends on resources that provide pre-computed trees.  Currently, OpenTree is the only resource we are using.  Large parts of OpenTree's synthetic tree are based on taxonomy alone: this is why there are so many polytomies.  If you know of published phylogenies that would cover some of these gaps, and you want to help, see <a href="#betterPlace">"How can I make the world a better place?"</a>.</p>

            <p>Our ability to deliver results quickly and conveniently depends on the availability of other resources that have programmable interfaces and provide good-quality data.  Click on "About" (above) to see a list of these resources. </p>
      
            <p>By making it incredibly easy to find results, the Phylotastic project <b>exposes both the strengths and weaknesses of these resources</b>.  If the results obtained here are misleading or incomplete, this means that the underlying resources can be improved.  For instance, if you find a part of the tree that is unresolved, and you are aware of published trees that provide more information, you can help out by notifying OpenTree or, better, <a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator">becoming a curator yourself</a> and adding the tree to OpenTree's database, so that it will be included automatically the next time a supertree is computed.</p>
