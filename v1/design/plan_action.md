##Plan of action:
               
### New use-cases with information from the community:
   * The community will be contacted via e-mail and interview
       * The 'community' consists of 
           - scientists and curators of all biodiveristy
           - Educators: middle & high school teachers and general bio lecturers
           - the general public are people in federal/state/private positions or those interested in phylogenetics
     * organize uses-cases from the community, post on github
     * develop requirements of all of the use-cases gathered (ours plus the community)
