    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>What we do</h2>
       <p>Until recently, expert knowledge on phylogenetic relationships-- the Tree of Life-- was scattered in thousands of inaccessible publications.  Then the <a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org//">OpenTree project</a> processed thousands of publications to generate a "synthetic tree" covering millions of species, a resource with enormous potential both for educational purposes and to guide research. </p>
       <p>Yet, there is still a very large accessibility gap, making it unlikely that this trove of knowledge will flow into the hands of scientists, educators, and the public.  </p>
       <p>The Phylotastic project aims to lower the barriers to accessing the tree of life: we want to make getting a species tree just as easy-- and as fast-- as getting online driving directions.  We solve problems involved in using scientific names, extracting relationships, integrating time-scales, and finding images and other resources about species. </p>
     <h2>How it works</h2>
     <p>For users, the part that you see-- the <a href="http://phylo.cs.nmsu.edu:3000/">web portal</a> or the mobile app-- are just two of the many possible <b>front-ends</b> or "clients" that use an underlying toolbox of <b>phylotastic web services</b>, each with a defined role providing data or operations.  Many of our services rely on key information resources such as: 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/">OpenTree</a></li> 
        <li><a href="http://eol.org/">Encyclopedia of Life</a> - images, information for mash-ups</li>
        <li><a href="http://gnrd.globalnames.org/">Global Names Recognition and Discovery</a> - finding name-like strings and validating them against taxonomic databases</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> - occurrence records matching a species with a location</li>
        <li><a href="http://datelife.org//">DateLife</a> - chronograms (trees with dates based on the fossil record)</li>
      </ul>
   We aim to grow this toolbox into a sustainable community resource that is open to anyone and that evolves to integrate new resources and operations.  
     </p>

     <h2>How to get involved</h2>
      <p> The Phylotastic project is in many ways an <b>open</b> project.  We maintain a <a href="https://gitter.im/phylotastic/phylotastic">public channel</a> for project information. Our source code is all available on <a fhref="https://github.com/phylotastic">github</a>.  We welcome feedback and are open to new opportunities to collaborate (use the Feedback form). </p>

     <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>The Phylotastic project is an NSF-funded research project ("Collaborative Research: ABI Development: An open infrastructure to disseminate phylogenetic knowledge", NSF 1458572) with 3 centers and 4 work sites.
